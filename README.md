# Heart Failure Prediction

Team Name: The Cool Data Scientists

Group: Sneha Jaikumar, Sarthi Patil, Graham Caron

Our heart failure prediction dataset consists of 12 features that can be analyzed to predict mortality by heart failure so patients can receive proper care early on.

Plot Conclusions:
Individuals with a higher creatinine phosphokinase level tend to have an increased mortality rate. However, these individuals are also likely to not have high blood pressure. Those who smoke have a lower ejection fraction, whereas those who do not smoke have a higher level of serum creatinine, yet higher levels of serum creatinine tend to be associated with a greater mortality rate. This led us to the following conclusions: Higher levels of creatinine phosphokinase may seem beneficial in that it does not indicate high blood pressure, but this could also serve as a risk for potential heart failure. Similarly, those who do not smoke tend to have a higher level of serum creatinine, but this also serves as a risk for potential heart failure.
